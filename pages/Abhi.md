# Why Abhi??

- In Home they used to call me Abhi ðŸ˜ƒ also as this name will get struck into mind of any peoples and they will always remeber this name first ðŸ¤—.

- Due to people always remebering people always call me for assisting their work,I really hate that part in my name while people using it ðŸ˜“.

- Abhi is a easy grasp name as any new born can call me easily than calling Amma or Appa because I can be called with one word B or else Bhi ðŸ˜‚. (_I Know it's now that funny_)

- This Name is also used mostly in my life and daily passage with my colleagues it's being used mostly. ðŸ˜‡
